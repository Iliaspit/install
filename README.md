# A Quick Calabash install script for OS X
On OS X Maverics and above, Ruby is already installed in version 2.0 or above. On these systems installing Calabash without having to call sudo can be done by running this command


    ruby <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/calabash/install/master/install-calabash-local-osx.rb)

Obviously we recommend reading through that script before actually running it.
